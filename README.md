Note: I included an H2 database for convienence. Please refer to my 'applications.properties' file.

Project objective:

Create a servlet-based web application that shows a form to add new products. A MySQL database will be created to store product data. The form data will be validated,
and a row will be added to the database. All database processing will be done using Hibernate.
